1,Ogre,event_1,"A sudden collapse of distant scaffolding. Dust pours down nearby buildings like fog. An old woman walks past the exorcists muttering, “He’s still down there…”—but no one remembers seeing her before."
2,Ogre,event_2,Lights in the entire sector flicker then fail. Phones gain a contact labeled “Father” with no call history. If answered: just wet breathing. Spiral architecture subtly warps—rooms feel shorter; hallways stretch into yawns.
3,Ogre,event_3,"A delivery man screams and flees the scene after glimpsing an exorcist’s shadow. “It’s inside your shape,” he says. Later, a PC discovers one of their psyche burst effects went off… but they didn't trigger it."
4,Ogre,enter_palace,All staircases descend. Elevators only go down. NPCs grow increasingly reluctant to speak—even ones who helped earlier. One exorcist sees a bruised child in their path wearing their own childhood face.
5,Ogre,palace_pressure,“You don’t need help. You need to give up.” Graffiti appears in a location the exorcists visited earlier. Surveillance shows it was never there before. Local water turns white and tastes of copper.
6,Toad,event_1,A storefront vanishes. Not destroyed—just gone. The building is now a blank wall. A nearby gangster pays one of the exorcists to “find out who’s stealing the street.” They’re carrying designer clothes made of paper.
7,Toad,event_2,"Every NPC has a new item: gold cufflinks, diamond earrings, Rolex. One bystander now rides a car swallowed whole by Gildrem previously. They insist it’s always been theirs. They wink at the exorcists and say, “You’ll get yours soon.”"
8,Toad,event_3,"A random PC finds a glowing gemstone in their pocket. It whispers, “Don’t tell the others.” Later, a local news report claims the PCs are part of a heist gang stealing from the city. A wanted poster appears—in the host’s name."
9,Toad,enter_palace,"One ally or contact offers a bribe to abandon the hunt. A wall of jewelry appears across the street and disappears seconds later. Any cash carried by the exorcists becomes counterfeit—except for one note, which reads “You’re worth this.”"
10,Toad,palace_pressure,A local celebrity goes missing. Their social media floods with praise for Gildrem’s “art exhibit.” That location turns out to be a sealed gallery guarded by Toadspawn. One NPC tries to sell you something that belonged to someone you failed to save.
11,Hound,event_1,"A popular broadcast glitches. For 6 seconds, all screens show Vanshara’s palace. One NPC claims to recognize it from childhood. Cultists begin handing out flyers titled “Rehearsal Notice” with a blank time and location."
12,Hound,event_2,"An exorcist hears their name whispered in a crowd repeatedly. A child follows them holding a drawing titled “You, in the Show.” That child’s parent insists they never brought anyone. A group of NPCs begin dressing like the exorcists."
13,Hound,event_3,"Two NPCs loudly argue over which exorcist “performed better.” They try to vote on who should lead next. One exorcist gains a fan club without explanation. A cultist offers an autograph of someone they’ve never met, with your signature."
14,Hound,enter_palace,"Vanshara appears on every active screen for a single beat, winks, and says “You’re late to your call.” One exorcist experiences a flashing image of themselves on stage, but crowned. They begin receiving psychic “applause.”"
15,Hound,palace_pressure,"All NPCs seem aware of the hunt but refer to it as “the season finale.” One exorcist sees a mirror that shows their worst memory re-enacted with applause. A cultist begins narrating your movements aloud, as if you’re a character in their show."
16,Centipede,event_1,"A city worker screams, pulls off their jacket, and flees down a tunnel. You find it later—folded neatly and placed upright in the middle of a street. Inside is a photo of someone the exorcists couldn’t save last loop."
17,Centipede,event_2,Security footage shows an NPC entering a shop. They never come out. The shop is now boarded up. A survivor NPC starts coughing acid. The exorcists watch a billboard glitch to display the word: WRONG.
18,Centipede,event_3,"Bystanders collapse in the middle of a sidewalk, twitching. One exorcist smells a memory—like antiseptic and sorrow. A body emerges from a sewer dressed like the exorcist but with the face reversed."
19,Centipede,enter_palace,All roads slope slightly downward. The sky flickers like broken video. An NPC calls you by your name—but you never gave it. Your shadow crawls independently for the rest of the hunt.
20,Centipede,palace_pressure,"The buildings melt, not with heat, but grief. A scream plays backwards through a convenience store radio. A random exorcist feels bugs crawling beneath their fingernails for 30 seconds. There's nothing there."
21,Idol,event_1,"A stray dog barks in rhythm—like a verdict. The air smells of copper. NPCs seem afraid not of you, but of being near you. Someone confesses to a crime they didn’t commit—and dies hours later from “falling down the stairs.”"
22,Idol,event_2,"The exorcists pass a public display of missing persons posters. Every face is inverted. An ally says, “I think I used to know one of them,” and starts crying. Bloodstains appear under their boots."
23,Idol,event_3,An exorcist finds a message on their phone: “You are being watched. You are being found guilty.” It vanishes after one minute. They later recognize a victim’s face in a shop mirror—only no one else sees it.
24,Idol,enter_palace,The Lord’s name appears in graffiti near the alleyway: ASHVIRE WAS RIGHT. All clocks run backward. You hear the sound of a gavel crack in the distance—but no one reacts.
25,Idol,palace_pressure,A news broadcast suddenly cuts to a segment about “grudge killings” with zero context. A random NPC begins listing sins the exorcist committed in past loops—none of which they should know.
26,Lord,event_1,"A gas station sign displays fuel prices from 20 years ago. A child asks an exorcist, “Was everything better then?” and then walks backward, disappearing into a mist."
27,Lord,event_2,A character sees a funeral procession—but it’s theirs. A random NPC swears it’s “just a historical reenactment.” One exorcist dreams of a birthday party they never had. Everyone in attendance wears the Sin’s crown.
28,Lord,event_3,You pass a soldier with no name tag who salutes the exorcists. The salute feels… earned. A local law enforcement officer begins using archaic speech and calls one of the exorcists “Champion of the Trial.”
29,Lord,enter_palace,All paperwork inside buildings refers to a monarch. Children play with “Time Tokens” they claim were issued by the government. Everyone seems to recognize the exorcists as historical figures—but the dates don’t line up.
30,Lord,palace_pressure,Buildings rearrange themselves like chessboards. A new law is posted outside the Palace: “No dissent shall be tolerated beyond the veil.” One exorcist gains a temporary {chess piece} title—though they don’t remember earning it. They can only move and affect spaces allowed by their title.
31,spiral,fail_key_roll,"The walls nearby gain shallow carvings of the failed die roll. Hours later, the number reappears on the exorcist’s arm in ink. A bystander walks past murmuring “Better luck next time.”"
32,spiral,hook_full,That Hook’s word/phrase starts appearing in graffiti. The next event location smells like the memory tied to that Hook. One NPC whispers the Hook aloud—but claims they didn’t say anything.
33,spiral,injury,A medical scanner glitches. It identifies the exorcist’s wound as “nonexistent” despite the bleeding. A previously seen NPC now wears a bandage in the exact same spot. They won’t explain it.
34,spiral,bystander_death,People in the area begin walking in choreographed synchronicity for 30 seconds—then resume normal behavior. A child offers a gift: the exact item the bystander dropped when they died.
35,spiral,pressure_up,Time glitches: watches run backwards for 30 seconds. One exorcist’s voice is replaced by the Sin’s voice on a single sentence. A local newspaper updates retroactively with false front-page history.
36,spiral,sin_threat,"The sky dims despite the hour. Doors on buildings slam shut without wind. One NPC walks away, sobbing, saying, “That’s how it ends.” The exorcists are left staring at an object that wasn’t there before."
